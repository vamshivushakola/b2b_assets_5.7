Together with the fast 1-hour charger, this means it's easy to keep model 2321 ready for instant use whenever it's needed.

The 19-position Varitorque clutch allows precise driving without risk of overtightening, and the extra full lock-up setting means maximum torque is always available for drilling and heavy screwdriving. The forward/reverse function allows easy direction change for screwdriving. An electronic brake prevents over tightening of screws and ensures fast rotation stop for quick and efficient working.<br/> <br/><b>Built-in LED spotlight and convenient handling</b><br/>Next to its superior Li-Ion battery technology, convenient handling is model 2321's main plus-point. For example the built-in LED spotlight at the base of the handle is ideal for working in dark corners and poorly lit areas. The ergonomically T-shaped design and light weight of only 1 kg allow easy, well balanced handling, especially when working in tight spaces, overhead or on a ladder.<br/><br/>The softgrip handle and rear body surfaces make handling the tool comfortable and secure. The sturdy 10 mm half-metal keyless chuck underlines the durability of this new Skill cordless drill/driver.<br/><br/><b>Choice of standard carton or +Set executions</b><br/>The new Skill 2321 cordless drill/driver is available in a choice of executions. As well as a standard retail carton, there is also a Skill +Set package which adds an extra 1.3Ah Li-Ion battery for even longer continuous working.";"";""

"3887123";"DH40MRY";"DH40MRY";"The DH40MRY from Hitachi is an SDS-Max rotary demolition hammer with UVP (User Vibration Protection). Utilising a dynamic counterweight and system of dampers, vibration is reduced by over 50%. Lower vibration equals reduced user fatigue and extended tool life. The DH40MRY provides 10.5 Joules of impact energy for faster drilling and quicker material removal in chiseling operations. Low vibration and high performance make the DH40MRY more productive, meaning you work smarter, not harder.<br/>The bit holder has a variable lock mechanism to allow a chisel to be set at the correct angle for the work, and the gearbox can be put in neutral position to allow chisels to be easily adjusted. The sturdy aluminium casing and double insulation construction of the DH40MRY make this an ideal site tool. Solid bits can be used up to a maximum size of 40mm, and when fitted with a TCT core bit holes of up to 105mm can be drilled. Auto stop carbon brushes make tool maintenance easier and so prolong the life of the drill. The DH40MRY comes complete with side handle, depth stop and carrying case.";"";""

That means it can be charged at any time, even if it is not completely empty, and can be re-used before charging is completed, all without negative effects on the battery's lifetime and capacity. Together with the fast 1-hour charger, this means it's easy to keep model 2321 ready for instant use whenever it's needed.

The 19-position Varitorque clutch allows precise driving without risk of overtightening, and the extra full lock-up setting means maximum torque is always available for drilling and heavy screwdriving. The forward/reverse function allows easy direction change for screwdriving. An electronic brake prevents over tightening of screws and ensures fast rotation stop for quick and efficient working.<br/> <br/><b>Built-in LED spotlight and convenient handling</b><br/>Next to its superior Li-Ion battery technology, convenient handling is model 2321's main plus-point. For example the built-in LED spotlight at the base of the handle is ideal for working in dark corners and poorly lit areas. The ergonomically T-shaped design and light weight of only 1 kg allow easy, well balanced handling, especially when working in tight spaces, overhead or on a ladder.<br/><br/>The softgrip handle and rear body surfaces make handling the tool comfortable and secure. The sturdy 10 mm half-metal keyless chuck underlines the durability of this new Skill cordless drill/driver.<br/><br/><b>Choice of standard carton or +Set executions</b><br/>The new Skill 2321 cordless drill/driver is available in a choice of executions.

Low vibration and high performance make the DH40MRY more productive, meaning you work smarter, not harder.<br/>The bit holder has a variable lock mechanism to allow a chisel to be set at the correct angle for the work, and the gearbox can be put in neutral position to allow chisels to be easily adjusted. The sturdy aluminium casing and double insulation construction of the DH40MRY make this an ideal site tool. Solid bits can be used up to a maximum size of 40mm, and when fitted with a TCT core bit holes of up to 105mm can be drilled.
